# SGSITS Parking
Parking in bustling city environments presents significant challenges, contributing to
traffic congestion, larger waiting times, and fuel consumption[1]. Studies indicate that 30
percent of cars in traffic spend an average of eight minutes searching for available spaces,
resulting in fuel wastage, monetary expenses, and time loss.[2]
Existing solutions to address parking inefficiencies include traditional parking systems,
manual reservation processes, and Singaporeâ€™s parking.sg[3]. However, these methods
often lack real-time information on parking availability and fail to streamline the parking
process effectively.
To mitigate these challenges, we propose the implementation of a "Smart Parking
Management System." Leveraging IoT technologies and OTP-based entry for heightened
security, our system allows users to book parking spaces in advance through a user-friendly
mobile application. A cloud-based application facilitates efficient real-time management
of parking spaces and maintains a secure database of registered drivers, enabling online
payment transactions. The primary objective of the Smart Parking Management System is
to streamline the often time-consuming process of finding an open parking slot in crowded
lots. By offering real-time information on parking availability and enabling users to reserve
parking slots through a dedicated application, our system enhances user convenience and
contributes to more effective land and traffic management in urban areas.
The proposed Smart Parking Management System will utilize PHP and MYSQL for
the development of both the IoT infrastructure and the Web application, ensuring seamless
integration and efficient performance.
